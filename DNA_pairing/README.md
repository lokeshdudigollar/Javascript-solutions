//Pairs of DNA strands consist of nucleobase pairs. 
//Base pairs are represented by the characters AT and CG,
// which form building blocks of the DNA double helix.
//Write a function to match the missing base pairs for the provided DNA strand. 
//For each character in the provided string, find the base pair character. 
//Return the results as a 2d array.
//For example, for the input GCG, return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"], ["G", "C"]]
