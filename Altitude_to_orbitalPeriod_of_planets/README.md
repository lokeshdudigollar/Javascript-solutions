According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period  T  of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:

T=2π(sqrt(a^3/μ))
 
a  is the orbit's semi-major axis
μ=GM  is the standard gravitational parameter
G  is the gravitational constant,
M  is the mass of the more massive body.
Return a new array that transforms the elements' average altitude into their orbital periods (in seconds).
